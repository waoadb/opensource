## Local Development

> ðŸ’¡ These instructions are intended for the Different Breed Team, If you require changes or additional features please raise an issue within Github.

### Linking

The parent repo housing this component is a Mono repo powered by Lerna. To use this package locally in a theme, simply add the following code to your `package.json` file and run `yarn` to link the package.

```jsx
"@waoadb/js-client-sdk": "*",
```

### Build

When running the plugin with our theme, We ideally do not want to run watch tasks for each package being used as this lead to additional RAM being used. For the purposes of editing packages we ideally want to use the storybook instance to test changes then initiate a build to pull those changes into the project we are working on.

To build a package, run the following command:

```jsx
yarn packages:build
```

### Publishing

Package publishing is powered by Lerna versions and can be run using the following command.

```jsx
yarn packages:publish
```

This will perform the following: Build the package, increase the version and then release the package to NPM. It is worth noting that only team accounts may publish to the NPM organisation. Please contact your team lead for these permissions.
