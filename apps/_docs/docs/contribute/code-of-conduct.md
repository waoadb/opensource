# Code Of Conduct

## **Our Pledge**

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation.

## **Our Standards**

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

- The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## **Our Responsibilities**

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviours they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## **Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, as well as situations where an individual represents the project or community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Project maintainers may provide further definition and clarification of representation.

This Code of Conduct also applies outside of project spaces when there is a reasonable belief that an individual's behaviour may negatively impact the project or its community.

## **Enforcement**

If you witness or experience abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour, please report it to the project team at [opensource@differentbreed.events](mailto:opensource@differentbreed.events). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and we will respond appropriately to the circumstances. We are committed to maintaining confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who fail to follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
