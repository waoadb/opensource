# Accessibility

> Please note that we are actively working to meet this standard. We decided to launch the open source project early, and as a result have chosen to roll out fixes over the coming weeks instead of rushing them for the initial release.

## Our Commitment

As a business, Different Breed ® exists with the mission of creating experiences that tear down barriers. We believe that to achieve this mission, we must first remove the barriers that prevent people from having accessible and inclusive experiences.

Accessibility is at the core of our day-to-day operations. We are committed to leaving a mark on the industry by delivering high-quality experiences that are built with accessibility at the forefront.

## Our Compliance Goal

(Level AA)

Accessibility is at the core of Different Breed ®'s mission. All themes and packages undergo testing for AA level compliance before being released into the `production` branch for others to use.

However, our team is not infallible, and we rely on community feedback to correct any issues. If you notice anything amiss, please [open an issue](https://github.com/waoadb/opensource/issues) on the repository and describe the problem. Together, we can improve the experience for everyone.

## How We Test

To ensure accessibility compliance, we perform the following quality assurance during the development lifecycle of new features:

- Axe dev tools - We use Axe's powerful developer tools to scan static code across our site and identify any accessibility issues in the markup we produce and the colors we use.
- VoiceOver - We utilize VoiceOver built into the Mac operating systems to ensure that all journeys can be completed based on voice alone and that appropriate feedback is given to the user for each interaction event.
- Manual Testing - On top of the automated tools we have in place, all work is tested manually by developers to ensure that interaction-based elements meet the required WCAG 2.1 specification for keyboard gestures.

Additionally, we plan to bring in regular audits from accessibility professionals. We will share the reports publicly with the hope that as a community, we can grow and learn together what's best for the end user.
