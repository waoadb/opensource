# Our Standards

> How you develop your theme is up to your own team to define, however, we have provided some best practices that we use to ensure the best possible experience for our users.

---

Within the active development of Different Breed ® Open Source we use the same industry standards that our core team use to create and maintain features on the core platforms.

By using these standards we intend to create an ecosystem that is easy to use and maintain, while also ensuring that the code is of the highest quality.

## Atomic Design & Storybook

We use the [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology for creating each component within our theme’s. This allows for rapid prototyping and delivery of new features while also bringing the fundamentals of a living design system to life. With this in mind, each theme comes bundled with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) that can be used to easily update and maintain components without the need to run the theme directly.

## Typescript & Eslint

We use Typescript and Eslint to ensure code quality and consistency. Typescript helps catch errors before they occur, while Eslint enforces code style guidelines and best practices. This leads to more maintainable and scalable code.

## React Ecosystem & Next JS

We use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and the [React](https://react.dev/) ecosystem internally to build powerful and scalable web applications with ease. Next.js provides server-side rendering capabilities and static site generation, which allows us to build fast and SEO-friendly web applications. Additionally, the React ecosystem provides a rich set of tools and resources that help us build complex applications with ease.

By using these technologies, we are able to simplify the development process and improve the overall developer experience. This allows us to build high-quality web applications quickly and efficiently, reducing the time-to-market and enabling us to iterate faster.

Overall, Next.js and the React ecosystem have become our go-to solution for building modern and scalable web applications internally, and we continue to use and evolve these technologies to meet the needs of our growing business.
