# Different Breed ® - Open Source

## What is Different Breed ® - Open Source?

Different Breed ® Open Source is a collection of themes and packages designed to enhance a developer's experience when integrating with our platform.

The following project types are currently available:

- Themes: We offer a suite of self-service themes on the platform, all located within the `apps/` directory of this repository. These themes enable existing Different Breed ® customers to move to a custom solution without requiring a full rebuild of the experience. They also provide developers with a solid foundation to start with or build upon.
- Packages: The `/packages` directory contains the code that powers the SDKs offered by Different Breed ®. We recommend installing these packages via NPM, and the code is available in this repository to show what happens under the hood.

## Our Motivations

As a business, Different Breed ® exists with the mission to create experiences that tear down barriers. We believe that to achieve this mission, we must first remove the barriers that prevent people from offering accessible and inclusive experiences.

By open-sourcing our platform's themes and packages, we hope to remove the barriers to getting up and running with Different Breed ®, allowing developers and customers to get started quickly while still retaining full control over the experience they deliver.

Our goal is simple: we wish to reduce the setup time on projects and empower agencies and developers to use more of the budget to create experiences that make an impact on the end-user.

All of our open-source themes aim to meet AA levels of compliance in reference to [WCAG2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) spec for accessibility, and we are committed to ensuring that whoever chooses our open-source work is set up from the beginning with solid foundations to continue that level of standard.

Whether you choose to use Different Breed ® or wish to use our components elsewhere, we wish you all the best and can't wait to see the wonderful work you create.
