# Reporting Security Issues

If you believe that you have found a security vulnerability in Different Breed ® Open Source, please let us know right away. We encourage you to report all concerns to [opensource@differentbreed.events](mailto:opensource@differentbreed.events) with the subject line "Security Issue With Open Source". We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to fix the problem as quickly as possible.

At the moment, we do not have a bug bounty program. When we release one, we will update this file to reflect it.
