# Overview

## Why We Open Source Our Themes

At Different Breed Â®, we offer a range of self-service themes within the platform so customers can easily get up and running in just a few minutes, opposed to the weeks that are standard in the industry.

While this is great, it poses a problem for customers who wish to switch to a custom offering. Traditionally, if a user wanted to move to a custom integration to bring in a CMS, it would require a complete rebuild of their website with a custom integration being completed by a development team.

This is not what we want to promote! We envision a different and more open future where customers can outgrow the self-service option and take their website with them as a solid foundation that can be built upon instead of starting from scratch.

To make this vision a reality, we are open-sourcing all the themes we offer for self-service and committing to ensuring that each theme is built to modern standards. This can empower an agency or development team to spend more of their budget on creative innovation, opposed to re-creating what should already be there.
