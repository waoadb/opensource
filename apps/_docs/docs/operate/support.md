# Browser Support

## Supported Browsers

Different Breed® Open Source supports evergreen browsers, which include the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, as well as up to 2 previous versions from the current release. This means that the themes and packages are designed to work with the most up-to-date browser versions, ensuring the best possible experience for end-users.

## Older Browsers

While older browsers may still be supported by Different Breed®, our core is designed to use progressive enhancement to ensure that the experience is still usable for all users. However, please note that we do not actively test against older browsers and cannot guarantee that the experience will be the same as the latest versions.

When supporting older browsers, you may need to use polyfills to support the features that are not available. We recommend using [core-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/core-js) for this purpose.
